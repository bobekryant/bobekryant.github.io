<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
I am writing under this pseudonym in honor of my favorite athlete, someone who has inspired and motivated me throughout my life.
He is arguably one of the best basketball ball players to ever play the game and yet he said his goal was to be remembered as an overachiever.
RIP 2020-01-26.

<p>
This blog is a place for me to reason out some of my thoughts in a more coherent manner and to create timestamps for these ideas.
The main two topics will be my two biggest passions: finance and sports.
On the finance side, I will write about interesting investments in the traditional markets and in the crypto space.
Regarding sports, most of the posts will focus around sports analytics and sports betting.
I would also like to apologize in advance for typos and bad grammar, my worst grades in college were in my humantities classes.
</p>

<h3>Finance</h3>
<h5>Traditional Markets</h5>
<p>
I have been investing/trading for over a decade.
In this blog, I want to focus on popular tailwinds and how they may benefit certain industries and players in the upcoming decade.
In the sector space, I have a particular interest in tech (more specifically SaaS) sector and will be looking at these companies closely.
In addition, I will also examine the global macro space from a long term investor standpoint.[ref]I trade these products at a low latency for my day job.[/ref] 
</p>

<h5>Crypto Markets</h5>
<p>
I have been around crypto since my college suite-mate introduced me to Litecoin mining in the early 2010's. 
Since then there have been two bull markets and two bear markets in this space, while stocks have just gone up.
The pace of crypto in general moves faster than traditional markets and it also trades around the clock 24/7.
I will be posting my thoughts about the future of crypto, especially as it relates to the various exchanges and DeFi space.

<h3>Sports</h3>
<p>
Sports analytics and sports betting are still in the nascent stages.
The legal sports betting handle is  a magnitude lower than the illegal sports betting handle, which leads to lower consolidated volume and higher vigs.
Good clean data to do analytics is even harder to come by.
Unlike in finance, where many fin-tech companies entire business model revolve around cleaning and selling data, when dealing with sports the data is hard to come by. 
For instance, the NBA actively changes their api to prevent scraping.
The pipeline requires the ability to web-scrape, store, and clean the data before any analysis can be done.
Nonetheless, I have built robust pipelines for the NBA[ref] The NBA topics are decently technical.[/ref], NFL, and UFC and I will share interesting insights and tidbits on each sport. 
I will try to open source as much code as possible so others can play around with data and code.

<h3>Closing Thoughts</h3>
<p>
I have a statistics background and my day job is a quant so my posts will lean on the quantitative side.
