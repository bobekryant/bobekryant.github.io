Summary: Breaking down funding rates

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>
This is the first of many posts where I lay out my fundamental thesis for altcoins. 
Investing in these altcoins coins is risker than \$BTC and \$ETH as they have higher betas, but the upside is enormous.
The return profile is similar to VC who investing in tech startups: most of the projects go bust, but a few of the winners can pay for all the losers and more.
Unlike in traditional startups who adjusts valuations between rounds, crypto altcoins have constant price feedback, creating a lot of volatility especially at the lower market caps.
