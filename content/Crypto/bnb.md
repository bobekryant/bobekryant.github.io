Summary: The Curious Case of BNB

<p>
I first found out about Binance when it launched in 2017. They were one of the first exchanges to offer a coin tied to the success of the exchange. Since launch, they have become the largest Crypto exchanges with revenues exceeding one billion last year. 
Since launch, the Binance coin, \$BNB, ICOed at \$0.1 and now its current market price is over \$17.
